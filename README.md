Campus Accessibility Navigation System with Facilities and Event Integration

This project involves creating an accessibility-focused navigation system for campus that integrates with the university's facilities management database and events calendar. The platform will provide accessible route planning across campus while incorporating real-time information about construction, elevator outages, and temporary accommodations for events.
