## üìò Overview
This project was developed for the **Software Requirements Engineering (CSE6224)** course at Multimedia University during the March/April 2025 trimester. It aims to address navigation and accessibility challenges faced by students and staff on campus by proposing a mobile-based navigation system that integrates real-time facility data, event schedules, and notification capabilities.

## üìå Vision
The core objective of the system is to:
- Improve **campus accessibility** through real-time routing,
- Deliver timely **event and facility updates**, and
- Empower users with **customizable notifications** and preferences.

## üì¶ Project Deliverables
This repository includes six formal documents that contribute to the planning and specification of the system:

### 1. `TT3L_G2_Project Vision.docx`
Defines the vision, scope, system objectives, and development goals. It outlines high-level system capabilities including:
- Accessibility-aware routing
- Facility and event integration
- Notification preferences and real-time updates

### 2. `TT3L_G2_ContextObject.docx`
Details the system‚Äôs primary context objects and their interactions, such as:
- **Students** (end users)
- **MMU Staff** (admins)
- **Facilities**, **Events**, and **Notifications**

It also maps **requirement sources**: stakeholder input, existing databases, and observed needs.

### 3. `TT3L_G2_Elicitation.docx`
Documents the full elicitation process:
- Techniques: Interviews, Surveys, Prototyping
- Stakeholders: MMU students and staff
- Categorized requirements based on findings
- Raw transcripts, templates, and visual references

### 4. `TT3L_G2_Kano Model.docx`
Applies the **Kano Model** to classify and prioritize user requirements:
- Basic, Performance, and Excitement Needs
- Indifferent and Reverse Needs
- Informed by survey data and prototyping feedback

### 5. `TT3L_G2_SRS.docx` (Software Requirements Specification)
Follows **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** standards to define:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Interface specifications
- ERD, Use Case, Activity, and State Diagrams
- Performance, usability, and security requirements

### 6. `TT3L_G2_Team Formation.docx`
Outlines team roles and individual contributions:
- Leadership, documentation, elicitation, prototyping
- Version control and collaboration tools used (GitHub, MS Teams, Google Docs)
- Challenges faced and how they were resolved
- Lecturer and participant acknowledgements

## üîß Tools Used
- **Figma**: Prototyping
- **Google Forms**: Survey collection
- **Microsoft Teams / WhatsApp**: Communication
- **GitHub**: Version control
- **Draw.io**: Diagrams
- **Microsoft Word / Google Docs**: Documentation


## üìú Acknowledgements
We would like to thank **Ms. Nur Haifa Mohd Fathil** for her support and validation, as well as our interview participants and all survey respondents for their valuable insights.
